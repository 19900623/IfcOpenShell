# Blender BIM IFC

_Under heavy development!_

Let's use Blender to create BIM models, because why not?

## Features

 - IFC4 is a first-class citizen. IFC4 has been an ISO standard since 2013, with
   the latest published in 2018. In contrast, other programs are dragging their
   feet with IFC2X3, published back in 2005.
 - Use Blender to do digital modeling! Blender is an amazing open-source
   software that supports the full 3D content creation pipeline that the CG
   industry uses. Don't let your designs fall short just because your modeling
   tool isn't good enough!
 - Create complex spatial structures with multiple sites, buildings, facilities,
   bridges, and building parts. In contrast, some BIM tools (uh, Revit?) don't
   even allow you to specify buildings.
 - Classify any geometry as any IFC type. Just because it is a wall doesn't
   mean you should be limited to modeling it in a certain way. Easily change
   from one type to another without damaging your geometry.
 - Allow BIM objects to instance a shared geometric representations. This allows
   you to place the same shape in multiple objects without drastically
   increasing your filesize.
 - Provide a custom value to any simple IFC attribute of an IFC product.
 - Create product types that regular IFC products can inherit attributes from.
 - Define your own property sets with control over exactly how the data in the
   property sets are stored.
